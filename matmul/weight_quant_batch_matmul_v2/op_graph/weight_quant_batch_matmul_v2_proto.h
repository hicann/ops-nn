/**
* @brief The fusion operator of antiquant function and matmul.

* @par Inputs:
* @li x: A matrix tensor. Shape supports (m,k)/(k,m), Format supports ND.
* The type support float16, bfloat16. The m value must be in [1, 65535] when
* transpose_x is true or [1, 2147483647] when transpose_x is false. The k value
* must be in [1, 65535].
* @li weight: A matrix tensor of quantized weight. Shape supports (n,k)/(k,n),
* Format supports ND/NZ. The type support int8, int4, int32, float8_e5m2, float8_e4m3fn, hifloat8, float4_e2m1, float4_e1m2. \n
* Format must be ND when the type is float8_e5m2, float8_e4m3fn or hifloat8.
* For Ascend 910_95 AI Processor, transpose_weight must be false when format is NZ. \n
* The k, n value must be in [1, 65535].
* The k value must be even when type is int4/float4_e2m1/float4_e1m2 and transpose_weight
* is true, and the n value must be even when type is int4/float4_e2m1/float4_e1m2 and transpose_weight
* is false. When type is int32, the input is int4-packed data,
* and shape supports (n, k/8)/(k, n/8).
* @li antiquant_scale: A tensor for antiquant scale.
* For different anti quantization modes, the per_tensor mode's shape supports
* (1)/(1,1), the per_channel mode's shape supports (n,)/(1,n)/(n,1), the per_group
* modes' shape supports (ceil(k/antiquant_group_size),n)/
* (n,ceil(k/antiquant_group_size)). Format supports ND. The type support
* float16, bfloat16, uint64 and int64. \n
* When the type is float16 or bfloat16, it should be the same with x. When the type is uint64 or
* int64, there are the following constraints: \n
* 1. antiquant_scale only support the per_channel mode. \n
* 2. x's type should be float16. \n
* 3. transpose_x should be false and transpose_weight should be true. \n
* 4. the m value must be in [1, 96] and the k, n value must be 64 aligned. \n
* 5. weight's type should be int8 and format should be ND. \n
* Additionally, the type supports float8_e8m0 when the weight dtype is float4_e2m1 or float4_e1m2.
* @li antiquant_offset: An Optional tensor for antiquant offset. Shape, format
* and type should be the same with antiquant_scale if antiquant_scale's type is
* not uint64/int64. If antiquant_scale's type is uint64/int64, antiquant_offset should be int32.
* When weight dtype is float8_e5m2, float8_e4m3fn, hifloat8, float4_e2m1 or float4_e1m2, antiquant_offset is â€‹excluded from selection.
* @li quant_scale: An Optional tensor for quantization parameters.
* Shape supports (1)/(1,n), format supports ND.
* The type support float32, uint64.
* This parameter must exist when type of output is int8.
* This parameter must not exist when type of antiquant_scale is uint64/int64.
* @li quant_offset: An Optional tensor for quantization parameters.
* Shape and format is the same with quant_scale.
* The type support float32.
* This parameter must not exist when type of antiquant_scale is uint64/int64.
* @li bias: An Optional tensor. Shape supports (n)/(1,n), Format supports ND.
* When type of x is float16, the type of bias should be float16. When type of x
* is bfloat16, the type of bias should be float32 or bfloat16. \n
* Specifically, these optional inputs support the shape (0,). At this point,
* it means that the optional input doesn't exist.

* @par Attributes:
* @li transpose_x: A bool. x is transposed if true. Default: false.
* When transpose_x is true, x's shape is (k, m).
* @li transpose_weight: A bool. weight is transposed if true. Default: false.
* When transpose_weight is true, weight's shape is (n, k),
* antiquant_scale's shape should be (1)/(1,1)/(n,)/(n,1)/(n,ceil(k/antiquant_group_size)).
* When transpose_weight is false, weight's shape is (k, n),
* antiquant_scale's shape should be (1)/(1,1)/(n,)/(1,n)/(ceil(k/antiquant_group_size),n).
* @li antiquant_group_size: int, antiquant_group_size must in [0, k-1]
* and antiquant_group_size % 32 == 0. \n
* When antiquant_scale dtype is float8_e8m0, antiquant_group_size must be 32. \n
* When the antiquant_group_size is 0, it means that the per-group mode is not used. Default: 0. \n
* @li dtype: An int. Declare the output dtype, supports 1(float16), 2(int8), 27(bfloat16).
* Default: -1, if the input has quant_scale, the output dtype is int8,
* otherwise the output dtype is the same as the input x dtype.
* @li inner_precise: An int. Calculation mode, only supports 0(high precision), 1(high Performance). Default: 0

* @par Outputs:
* y: A matrix tensor. The type supports float16, bfloat16, int8. The format supports ND.
* The type should be int8 when quant_scale exist.
* The type should be the same with x when quant_scale not exits.

* @attention Constraints:
* @li It is not recommended to use weight NZ format on Atlas A2 Training Series Product/Atlas 800I A2 Inference Product/A200I A2 Box Heterogeneous Component,
* because its performance may not be better than ND format.
* @li All of these conditions must be met on Atlas Inference Series Product: weight type is int8,
* weight format is NZ, transpose_weight is true, x type is float16, antiquant_scale only support the per_channel mode,
* quant_scale not exists, quant_offset not exists, antiquant_group_size is 0.
* @li Per_channel mode: To improve performance, it is recommended to use the
* weight input after transposition. When the range of m is [65,96], it is
* recommended to use the antiquant_scale with data type UINT64/INT64.
