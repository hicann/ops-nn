 * @brief Apply norm operation for each tensor in a tensor list in manner of element-wise
 * @par Inputs:
 * Two inputs:
 * @li x: A tensor list containing multiple tensors. Shape dimension cannot be greater than 8 dimensions.
 * Format supports ND, and data type must be float16, float32 or bfloat16. The list supports a maximum length of 256.
 * @li scalar: A scalar with one element, indicating the order of norm.
 * Format supports ND, and data type must be int64, float32.
 * @par Outputs:
 * y: A tensor list which store the tensors whose value are the norm value of the x.
 * Shape dimension cannot be greater than 8 dimensions, and shapesize should be 1.
 * Format supports ND, and data type must be float16, float32 or bfloat16. The list supports a maximum length of 256.
