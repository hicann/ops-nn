/**
* @brief Computes the gradient of x through GeGluV2.
*
* @par Inputs:
* Three inputs, including:
* @li dy: A Tensor of the same type as "x".
      The shape of dy matches the shape of x in all dimensions except for the split dimension,
      where its length is half of the length of x's split dimension.
* @li x: A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: float16, bfloat16, float32.
      Shape supports at least 1 dimension, and at most 8 dimensions.
      The length of the split dimension in x must be an even number.
* @li gelu: A Tensor of the same type as "x".
      The shape of gelu matches the shape of x in all dimensions except for the split dimension,
      where its length is half of the length of x's split dimension.
*
* @par Outputs:
* dx: A Tensor. Has the same type as "x". Shape should be same as x.
*
* @par Attributes:
* @li dim: An optional Int. The dimension to be split, default is -1.
* @li approximate: An optional Int. Determines which formula to use for the activation computation.
* The gelu grad approximation algorithm to use: 0('none') or 1('tanh'), default is 1('tanh').
* Atlas Inference Series Product only supports 'tanh'(1).
* @li activate_left: An optional Bool.
* Whether the left side of x is used as an input parameter to the activation function,
* default is false, use the right side.
*
* @par Third-party framework compatibility
* Compatible with the Pytorch operator GeGluGradV2.
