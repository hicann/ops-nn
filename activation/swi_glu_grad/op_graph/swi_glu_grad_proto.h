    * has the same shape as "x" except for the dimension specified by the "dim" parameter. \n
    * The dimension size specified by "dim" is half of the corresponding dimension of x. \n
    * Must be one of the following types: bfloat16, float16, float32.
    * @li x: A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: bfloat16, float16, float32.

    * @par Outputs:
    * one Output, including:
    * x_grad: A Tensor, which is the gradient of x and has the same shape as "x". \n
    * Must be one of the following types: bfloat16, float16, float32.

    * @par Attributes:
    * one attribute, including:
    * @li dim: A optional int. The dimension to be split, default is -1.

    * @par Third-party framework compatibility:
    * New operator SwiGluGrad.
