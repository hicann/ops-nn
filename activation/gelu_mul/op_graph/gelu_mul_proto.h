    * @brief GeluMul divides the input tensor into left and right tensors x1 and x2 based on the last dimension,
    * performs GELU calculation on x1 on the left, and multiplies the calculation result by x2. \n

    * @par Inputs:
    * x: A tensor of type float, float16 or bfloat16. Shape support 2D ~ 8D.
    * The format must be ND.

    * @par Attributes:
    * approximate: A optional string. The GELU approximation algorithm to use: 'none' or 'tanh', default is 'none'.

    * @par Outputs:
    * y: A tensor has the same type and format as "x".
    * Other dimensions of its shape are the same as those of "x".
    * The value of the last dimension is half the value of the last dimension of "x". \n
