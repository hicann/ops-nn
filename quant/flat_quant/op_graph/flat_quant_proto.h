 * @brief Flatness matters for LLM quantization. \n
 *
 * @par Inputs:
 * @li x: A tensor. The original data input. 3-D with shape [K, M, N]. Must be one of the following types:
 * float16, bfloat16. The format support ND.
 * @li kronecker_p1: A tensor. Input calculation matrix 1. 2-D with shape [M, M]. The value of M is same as input "x".
 * Must be one of the following types: float16, bfloat16. Has the same type as input "x".
 * The format support ND.
 * @li kronecker_p2: A tensor. Input calculation matrix 2. 2-D with shape [N, N]. The value of N is same as input "x".
 * Must be one of the following types: float16, bfloat16. Has the same type as input "x".
 * The format support ND. \n
 *
 * @par Outputs:
 * @li out: A 3-D tensor of type int4. Output result data. Shape is same as input "x". The format support ND.
 * @li quant_scale: A tensor of type float32. Output quantization factor. 1-D with shape [K].
 * The value of K is same as input "x". The format support ND. \n

 * @par Attributes:
 * clip_ratio: An optional float. Used to control the quantization cropping ratio. Defaults to 1. \n
