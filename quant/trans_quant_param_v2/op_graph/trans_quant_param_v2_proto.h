/**
* @brief Transfer quant param from float32 to uint64.

* @par Inputs:
* @li scale: A quantization parameter tensor. Must be one of the following types: float32.
             The format support ND. The shape support 1D and 2D.
* @li offset: An optional quantization parameter tensor. Must be one of the following types: float32.
              The format support ND. The shape support 1D and 2D. \n

* @par Attributes:
* @li round_mode: fp32 filing to fp19 mode; 0: truncation and filing; 1: r_int mode;

* @par Outputs:
* @li y: output tensor. Must be one of the following types: uint64. The format support ND.
         The shape support 1D and 2D. \n

* @attention Constraints:
* @li The passed scale, y cannot be a null pointer.

* - Atlas A2 Training Series Product/Atlas 800I A2 Inference Product/A200I A2 Box Heterogeneous Component or
* Atlas A3 Training Series Product/Atlas A3 Inference Series Product or Atlas Inference Series Product or
* Ascend 910_95 AI Processor: \n
* This operator supports use with the matmul operator, such as QuantBatchMatmulV3. \n
* - Atlas A2 Training Series Product/Atlas 800I A2 Inference Product/A200I A2 Box Heterogeneous Component or
* Atlas A3 Training Series Product/Atlas A3 Inference Series Product or Atlas Inference Series Product: \n
* This operator does not supports use with the grouped matmul operator, such as GroupedMatmul. \n
* @li When there is no offset, the y shape is consistent with the scale shape: \n
* - If y is used as matmul input(e.g., QuantBatchMatmulV3), the shape support 1D (t,), with t equal to 1 or n, or 2D(1,
n),
* where n is the same as that of the right matrix in the matmul calculation. \n
* - If y is used as grouped matmul input(e.g., GroupedMatmul), the shape support 1D (g,), or 2D(g, n), (g, 1),
* where n is the same as that of the right matrix in the grouped matmul calculation, g is the same as that of
* the number of group num(i.e., group_list parameter's shape). \n
* @li When there is an offset, use it only as matmul input (e.g., QuantBatchMatmulV3): \n
* The shape of scale, offet and y support 1D (t,), with t equal to 1 or n, or 2D(1, n), where n is the same as
* that of the right matrix in the matmul calculation.
