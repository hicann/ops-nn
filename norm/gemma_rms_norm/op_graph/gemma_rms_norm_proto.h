/**
* @brief GemmaRmsNorm operator interface implementation. \n
*  calculating: x, gamma \n
*  rstd = np.rsqrt(np.mean(np.power(x, 2), reduce_axis, keepdims=True) + epsilon)) \n
*  y = (1 + gamma) * (x * rstd)

* @par Inputs
* Two inputs, including:
* @li x: A tensor of input. Represens the input data to be normalized. The format must be ND. Shape support 1D ~ 8D.
* Must be one of the following types: float16, float32, bfloat16.
* @li gamma: A tensor of input. Represents a learnable scaling factor.
* Must be one of the following types: float16, float32, bfloat16. Must have the same type as "x".
* The format must be ND. Shape support 1D ~ 8D.
* The shape must meet the requirements of gamma_shape = x_shape[n:], n < x_shape.dims().

* @par Attributes
* epsilon: Optional attribute to prevent division by 0. The type is float32. Defaults to 1e-6.

* @par Outputs
* Two outputs, including:
* @li y: A tensor of output. Indicates normalized data. The format must be ND. Shape support 1D ~ 8D.
* Must be one of the following types: float16, float32, bfloat16. Must have the same type, format and shape as "x".
* @li rstd: A tensor of output. Represents root mean square. The format must be ND. The type is float32.
* The shape is the same as the first several dimensions of the "x" shape.
* The first several dimensions refer to the dimension of "x" minus the dimension of "gamma",
* indicating that the norm is not required.
