*@par Inputs:
*Five inputs, including:
* @li dy: A tensor. The gradient tensor that represents the reverse calculation.
* Must be one of the following types: float16, float32, bfloat16. The format must be ND.
* The shape is equal to the shape of x, that is, [A1, ...,Ai,R1, ...,Rj].
* Has the same type and format as x.
* @li x: A tensor. First input of forward propagation. Must be one of the following types: float16, float32, bfloat16.
* The shape is equal to the shape of dy, that is, [A1, ...,Ai,R1, ...,Rj].
* Has the same type and format as dy.
* @li rstd: A tensor. Third output of forward propagation, indicating the reciprocal of the standard deviation of input.
* Must be one of the following types: float16, float32, bfloat16. The format must be ND.
* Has the same shape as mean, which is [A1,...,Ai,1,...,1], where there are j 1s after Ai,
* and j is the length of the axis that requires normalization.
* Has the same type and format as mean.
* @li mean: A tensor. Second output of forward propagation, indicating the mean value of input.
* Must be one of the following types: float16, float32, bfloat16. The format must be ND.
* Has the same shape as rstd, which is [A1,...,Ai,1,...,1], where there are j 1s after Ai,
* and j is the length of the axis that requires normalization.
* Has the same type and format as rstd.
* @li gamma: A tensor. Indicates the weight tensor.
* Must be one of the following types: float16, float32, bfloat16.
* The format must be ND. Has the same type as x. The shape is [R1,...,Rj].

*@par Outputs:
*Three outputs, including:
* @li pd_x: A tensor. Indicates the first output of the forward calculation, which is the output tensor of the x derivative.
* Must be one of the following types: float16, float32, bfloat16. The format must be ND.
* Has the same type, shape and format as x.
* @li pd_gamma: A tensor. Indicates the output tensor of gamma derivative.
* Must be one of the following types: float16, float32, bfloat16. The format must be ND.
* Has the same type, shape and format as gamma.
* @li pd_beta: A tensor. The bias tensor of forward output.
* Must be one of the following types: float16, float32, bfloat16. The format must be ND.
* Has the same type, shape and format as gamma.

*@par Attributes:
* output_mask: An optional attribute, a list composed of bool. Defaults value is {true, true, true}.
* The output_mask[0] is false, means pd_x is meaningless.
* The output_mask[1] is false, means pd_gamma is meaningless.
* The output_mask[2] is false, means pd_beta is meaningless.
* Except in Ascend 910_95 AI Processor, the output_mask just supports {true, true, true} in other AI Processor.

*@par Restrictions:
*Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS EXPERIMENTAL.  Please do not use.
