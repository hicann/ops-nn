 * @param [in] self: aclTensor on the NPU device. the data type can be float32/float16/bfloat16. The data format
 * supports ND.
 * @param [in] kernelSize: aclIntArray type, indicating the maxpooling window size.
 * @param [in] stride: aclIntArray type, the step size of the window movement.
 * @param [in] padding: aclIntArray type, number of padding layers for each edge. The value is negative infinity.
 * @param [in] dilation: aclIntArray type, controls the stride of elements in the window.
 * @param [in] ceilMode: bool type, when true, the output shape is calculated using round-up method. By default is
 * rounding down.
 * @param [in] out: aclTensor on the NPU device. the data type can be float32/float16/bfloat16. The data format supports
 * ND.
 * @param [in] indices: aclTensor on the NPU device. the data type can be int32. The data format supports ND.
 * @param [out] workspaceSize: Returns the workspace size that the user needs to apply for on the npu device side.
 * @param [out] executor: Return the op executor, including the operator calculation process.
 * @return aclnnStatus: Return the status code.
