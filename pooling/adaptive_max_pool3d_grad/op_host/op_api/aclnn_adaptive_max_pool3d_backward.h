 * @brief aclnnAdaptiveMaxPool3dBackward First segment interface. Calculate the workspace size based on the specific
 * calculation process. Function description: Calculates AdaptiveMaxPool3DGrad from the gradOutput and self, at the
 * result gradInput
 * @domain aclnn_ops_train
 * @param [in] gradOutput: gradient Tensor, which is the same as the positive output shape. It is aclTensor on the NPU
 * device side. The data type can be float32/float16/bfloat16. Data format: ND and discontinuous tensors are supported.
 * Only 4- or 5-dimensional tensors are supported. If there are four dimensions, the value of N is considered as 1, and
 * the value of each dimension must be greater than 0. If the value is five dimensions, all dimensions except dimension
 * 0 must be greater than 0. When dimension 0 is 0, gradInput is empty.
 * @param [in] self: aclTensor on the NPU device side, positive operator input. The data type can be
 * float32/float16/bfloat16. . Data format: ND and discontinuous tensors are supported. Only 4- or 5-dimensional tensors
 * are supported.
 * @param [in] indices: aclTensor on the NPU device side, which is the output of the forward operator. The index data
 * with the maximum value on the DHW plane is int64 and ND is supported. Supports discontinuous tensors. Only 4- or
 * 5-dimensional tensors are supported.
 * @param [in] gradInput: It is the same as the positive input shape. It is the aclTensor on the NPU device side. The
 * data type can be float16, float32, or bfloat16. Added the data format ND and discontinuous tensors.
 * @param [out] workspaceSize: Returns the workspace size that the user needs to apply for on the npu device side.
 * @param [out] executor: Return the op executor, including the operator calculation process.
 * @return aclnnStatus: Return the status code.
